It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a \"worst book\" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing.

       "21          I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is.  \n",

This does not mean that they should be charged 3 to 5 times in a row but rather that for the first 3 to 5 charge/discharge cycles, the batteries reach a higher charge level each time until they are recharged until they finally reach their rated capacity. This may be your problem. Try doing this and you might be pleasantly surprised.  \n",

       "2999970              Hawkins provides an excellent framework from which to carefully think about leadership as a lifestyle. He effectively argues against compartmentalizing the different areas of influence (e.g., family, work) in our lives, but instead, encourages the reader to balance the conflicts that are sure to arise. He also provides useful insights into managing our lives in each area of influence so that we prove ourselves faithful in each.The book is written in a concise and very readable manner.

His definition of spiritual, however, may be a little different than mine or yours.

If it was spiritual direction I was lacking I would be reading a religious text, not a book on leadership.  \n",

It's an EP length album with only six songs, only three of which are exclusive to this CD. You do get the original version of the closing theme (\"The Real Folk Blues\"), as well as the cute drum-laden clap-along tune, \"Doggy Dog\", and the short James-Bond-esque \"The Spy\" by Seat Belts (Yoko Kanno's bebop band), but the other songs are also on the other soundtracks.

       "2999986  The three films in this set are excellent, absolute classics of the genre. But because this set is incomplete, what is the point? They should be watched in order to really understand the story, and to see Nami's experiences in the order in which they played out. However \"Jailhouse 41,\" the second film is missing. So when you watch the first film, and then skip to the third, (Beast Stable) it makes no sense, because it starts out with \"The Scorpion\" outside of jail. Part 1 ended with Nami being returned to prison after dispatching the men who raped her, and the cop who used her. Not to ment...  \n",

In the rest of the CD, Tyler's voice is husky and \"wannabe\" country.

Hes a young, very good looking guy who writes a lot of his own music and plays his instruments. He's very talented and plays alot of music that anyone can relate to. His style of music is very unique but very catchy. If you like to feel for music...get up and dance... or just relax...he's def got it all! His style can be related to Hanson, Gavin Degraw, Johhny Lang, and Ryan Cabera. Nice mix huh? He's defenetly worth the money!!!! :) he's too cute too!!!! <3  \n",

I first heard Tyler when I was at a Hanson concert he was the opening act. Before that I had never heard of him. His performance was amazing and so when he was done we went out to get his autograph. He was so sweet he signed the date and my name as well and was gracious enough to do it on my Hanson tour book becuase I had not been able to get anything of his yet. Anyway he is a great person and his music is absolutely awsome. I highly recomend this cd!!!!!Melinda  \n",

I bought the lighter colored wood chair, which really makes the grime build up noticeable, especially on the foot rest. We clean the high chair all the time, but the wood almost has an absorbency about it and there's just so much you're able to get clean. And I'm not sure why some areas that have been cleaned have a sticky feeling to them except that maybe it's a reaction of the wood to the chemicals in disinfectant wipes.

It is really just a rehash of very old ideas about Carroll with some pop culture uncomfortably tacked on. The 'myth' has been dealt with far better by people who really seem to understand it (it's too deep I think for Brooker's milieu), and the pop culture is presented without any kind of analysis or penetration.I think you are better off with Leach's 'In the Shadow of the Dreamchild' or Sigler's 'Alternative Alices'.  \n",

Really glad I read the book first. Maybe I just expected too much. Really tired of good books being made into poor movies. Another example is Eragon. Highly recommend the book but not the movie.   \n",

Like \"Kiss the rain\" by Billie Myers when Dawson and Joey make up, and \"Say goodnight\" by Beth Neilsen Chapman at the end of season 1 when Dawson and Joey kiss. Overall I had not heard of 80% of the songs on the cd. Even though I am a hardcore show fanatic, I opted not to buy the so-called \"soundtrack\" Scott Engle, 14 Belleville, KS   \n",

       "5  \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\" is a British crime-fiction film and is a breakout offering by Director Guy Ritchie.The narrative is cleverly constructed and whilst groups of protagonists at first appear to standalone their interaction creates a fantastic series of events.The film contains a terrific cast and many of whom have become very well known since this work such as: Jason Flemyng (as Tom), Dexter Fletcher (plays Soap), Nick Moran (is Eddy), and Jason Statham (plays Bacon).It is quite a treat for viewers as the diversity of the story with its many turns and twists is absorbing...   \n",

As such this book is easy to use. With Joseph Campbell as the editor I feel assured that it is a good rendition of the myths. I found it relevant to specific images I wanted to learn about.

Overall I had not heard of 80% of the songs on the cd. Even though I am a hardcore show fanatic, I opted not to buy the so-called \"soundtrack\" Scott Engle, 14 Belleville, KS   \n",

While this might be cartologically indisputable, the rest of the world, including businesses, street signs, and locals use something called \"street names\", like \"Lawrenceville Hwy\" or \"Apple Avenue\" or whatever. This renders the program unusable in certain circumstances.
